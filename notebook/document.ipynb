      "FINAL ANSWER:\n",
      "Joseph of Egypt, as referred to in the Bible, is not the same person as Joseph, the eleventh son of Jacob. Joseph of Egypt, also known as Joseph the Dreamer or Joseph the Interpreter, is a significant figure in the Old Testament of the Bible. He is the son of Jacob (also known as Israel) and Rachel's handmaid, Zilpah. Joseph of Egypt is known for his ability to interpret dreams and for his role in saving Egypt and his family during a famine. This Joseph is not to be confused with Joseph, the eleventh son of Jacob and the first son of Rachel, who was sold into slavery by his brothers.\n",
